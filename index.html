            <p>Hello! Welcome to my page :)
                I offer training & nutrition coaching specializing in powerlifting programming, powerlifting meet prep, bodybuilding contest prep, and lifestyle coaching. 
                I believe the first priority for ANY individual with a desire to improve their health and fitness should be sustainability and longevity. A fitness regimen should be challenging but also complement a trainee's life and individual needs. After discovering significant enjoyment and passion through my own journey of lifting and nutrition, I want others to find sustainability, success, & passion in their fitness journey.
                All nutritional coaching and recommendations are macronutrient and flexible dieting based. I emphasize health first with absolutely NO quick fixes. The most important factors for success are consistency and dedication along with a fitness regimen that is challenging & sustainable. 
                        
                        Health and vitality should always be top focuses of any fitness regimen. Fads, extreme diets, and extreme levels of exercise are not sustainable, enjoyable, or realistic. 
                        
                        Contest prep services offered are tailed to each individuals needs. No training plans are cookie cutter or mass produced and no diet approach is the same. Each training program is formulated based on an extensive questionnaire to be filled out by potential clients prior to working together.
                        
                        Each plan comes with weekly check ins, unlimited email support, and video form analysis for training clients. All training plans are customized to client desires, schedules, time constraints, & goals. Cardio recommendations are included in all training and nutritional plans. Contest prep plans include peak week protocol and post-show guidelines.
                        
                        Each potential client will be required to fill out a questionnaire and all inquiries will be screened and evaluated to ensure a good client / coach fit. There is currently a waiting list of 2-3 weeks.
                        
                        Please fill out the following form and please list your goals by working together.
                        
                         I will contact you with an additional questionnaire! </p></div>
