            <p>I fell in love with the fitness and strength-training some-what later in life. It wasn't until my mid 20's that I started to take it seriously. I took the time to build endurance, gain muscle, and eventually competed in powerlifting on a local level. I remember what it was like not knowing what to do, or how to lift weights at all. I faced many many challenges and obstacles of adhering to programs and staying accountable. This is why, I want to work with YOU.<br> <br>
                
                I believe that a healthy mind is a healthy body. A training regimen should be challenging but it should not run you into the ground. It took years until I recognized that more is  not always better. The quality of your training and your life is what matters the most. I believe that taking care of your self outside of the gym is equally as important as the work you put in.
                <br> <br>
                
                My training programs and nutrition advice is based on the principle that there are no quick fixes. There are no secet pills. Hard work over a long period of time is ultimately what will bring you the best results of your life. All training plans are customized to the client's desires, schedules, time constraints, & goals. None of my training programs are exactly the same.
                <br> <br>
                Each training program is formulated based on an extensive questionnaire to be filled out by potential clients prior to working together.
                <br> <br>
                Powerlifting meet prep is also an option when you work with me. Each client will have access to weekly check ins, email support, and and form analysis through me. 
                <br> <br>

                After sending in your inquiry, I will follow up with you in 24-48 hours to further discuss your goals and aspirations in depth. I will have a more detailed questionnaire to make sure we are a good fit to work with each other.
